Understand the problem:
For this problem, there are several cases need to consider:
1. For comma, transform to |
2. If comma is inside a quote, don't treat the comma as separated. Remove the comma and print the entire token. e.g. "San Francisco, CA" => San Francisco, CA
3. If there are double quotes, remove one. e.g. "Alexandra ""Alex""" => Alexandra "Alex". 
Note that """Alexandra Alex""" becomes "Alexandra Alex" because we first remove the outer-most quote, and then remove one quote of the double quote.
